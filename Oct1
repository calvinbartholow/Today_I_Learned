Today was a sunday, meaning 8 hours of classtime.. Most of that time being spent preparing for our capstones. So I'd say i took the majority of the day learning more about many to many database relationships. Still not 100% but it's gettin there... I'm feeling a lot more comfortable learning new things now that I have the stuff we learned weeks ago down.
