Today, I decided to start writing in my TILs. We were introduced to the topic of APIs today, and I'm pretty stoked off learning how to use free data on the web. Makes me start to think about how I need to use that in my Capstone project. Why fill in all the grid myself when I can just write a program that does it for me?
